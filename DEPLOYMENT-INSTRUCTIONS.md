This comprehensive guide will help you deploy your Schamz Gaming React application using a domain from OnlyDomains.com hosted on SiteGround servers.

## What's Been Prepared

âœ… **Vite Configuration Updated**: The app is now configured with relative paths for traditional hosting  
âœ… **Production Build Ready**: Optimized files will be created in the `dist` folder  
âœ… **SPA Routing Support**: `.htaccess` file created for proper React Router functionality  
âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Compression and caching rules included  
âœ… **Security Headers**: Basic security configurations added  

## Complete Setup Process

### Phase 1: Domain Connection (OnlyDomains â†’ SiteGround)

**Step 1: Get SiteGround Nameservers**
1. Login to your SiteGround account
2. Go to **Websites** section
3. Click the **kebab menu** (three dots) next to your hosting account
4. Select **Website Settings** â†’ **Server Details**
5. Note down the nameservers (typically):
   - `ns1.siteground.net`
   - `ns2.siteground.net`

**Step 2: Update DNS at OnlyDomains**
1. Login to your OnlyDomains.com account
2. Go to **Domains** â†’ **My Domains**
3. Click on your domain name
4. Select the **DNS Settings** tab
5. Choose **Delegate to Your Name Servers**

   - Add `ns1.siteground.net`
   - Click **Add** after entering each nameserver
   - Add `ns2.siteground.net`
   - Click **Add**
7. Click **Delegate to Your Name Servers** to confirm
8. Wait 24-72 hours for DNS propagation

### Phase 2: Website Deployment on SiteGround

**Step 1: Build Your Application**
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates optimized files in the `dist` folder.

**Step 2: Access SiteGround File Manager**
1. Login to your SiteGround account
2. Go to **Websites** and select your site
3. Click **Site Tools**
4. Navigate to **Files** â†’ **File Manager**

**Step 3: Upload Website Files**
1. Navigate to the `public_html` directory
2. If there are existing files, backup or remove them
3. Upload all contents from your `dist` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder (contains CSS, JS, images)
   - `.htaccess` file (for routing support)
4. Ensure all files are uploaded to the root of `public_html`

**Alternative: FTP Upload Method**
1. In SiteGround Site Tools, go to **Files** â†’ **FTP Manager**
2. Create FTP credentials or use existing ones
3. Use an FTP client (FileZilla recommended):
   - Host: Your domain or SiteGround FTP server
   - Username: Your FTP username
   - Password: Your FTP password
   - Port: 21
4. Upload all `dist` folder contents to `public_html`

### Phase 3: Verification and Testing

**Step 1: Check DNS Propagation**
1. Use online tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check DNS propagation
2. Enter your domain name and check if it resolves to SiteGround servers
3. Wait for full propagation (up to 72 hours)

**Step 2: Test Your Website**
1. Visit your domain in a web browser
2. Test all navigation links and routes
3. Verify that refreshing pages works correctly (React Router test)
4. Check that all images and assets load properly

**Step 3: Enable SSL Certificate**
1. In SiteGround Site Tools, go to **Security** â†’ **SSL Manager**
2. Select **Let's Encrypt** for free SSL
3. Enable SSL for your domain
4. Force HTTPS redirect if desired

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Blank white page after deployment**
- **Cause**: Missing files or incorrect paths
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify all `dist` folder contents are uploaded
  - Check that `index.html` is in the root of `public_html`
  - Ensure `.htaccess` file is present

**Issue: 404 errors when refreshing pages** <mcreference link="https://mckenzie-company.com/tech-blog/how-to-host-react-on-siteground-or-any-other-traditional-hosting/" index="2">2</mcreference>
- **Cause**: Missing or incorrect `.htaccess` configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Verify `.htaccess` file is in `public_html` root
  - Check that mod_rewrite is enabled on server
  - Contact SiteGround support if needed

**Issue: Assets not loading (CSS/JS/Images)**
- **Cause**: Incorrect file paths or missing files
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure all files from `assets/` folder are uploaded
  - Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
  - Verify relative paths in `vite.config.js`

**Issue: Domain not pointing to SiteGround**
- **Cause**: DNS not fully propagated or incorrect nameservers
- **Solution**:
  - Wait longer for DNS propagation (up to 72 hours)
  - Double-check nameservers in OnlyDomains
  - Use DNS checker tools to verify propagation

### Performance Optimization

The included `.htaccess` file provides:
- **Gzip Compression**: Reduces file sizes for faster loading
- **Browser Caching**: Caches static assets for better performance  
- **Security Headers**: Basic protection against common attacks

### File Structure After Deployment
```
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ .htaccess
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].css
    â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].js
    â””â”€â”€ [other assets]
```

## Important Notes

### Domain Configuration
- If deploying to a subdomain or subfolder, you may need to update the `base` path in `vite.config.js`
- For subdirectories, change `base: './'` to `base: '/your-folder-name/'`

### SSL Certificate
- Most hosting providers offer free SSL certificates <mcreference link="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48431170/how-to-deploy-a-create-react-app-to-a-web-host-ex-siteground" index="1">1</mcreference>
- Enable SSL in your hosting control panel for HTTPS support

### Performance Optimization
- The `.htaccess` file includes compression and caching rules <mcreference link="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simple-guide-deploying-your-vite-react-app-cpanel-shishir-c4esc" index="4">4</mcreference>
- These will improve your website's loading speed

### Troubleshooting

**If your site shows a blank page:**
- Check that all files were uploaded correctly
- Ensure the `.htaccess` file is present
- Verify that your hosting supports `.htaccess` files

**If routing doesn't work (404 errors on refresh):**
- Confirm the `.htaccess` file is in the root directory
- Check that mod_rewrite is enabled on your server <mcreference link="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simple-guide-deploying-your-vite-react-app-cpanel-shishir-c4esc" index="4">4</mcreference>

**If images or assets don't load:**
- Verify all files from the `dist` folder were uploaded
- Check file permissions (usually 644 for files, 755 for folders)
